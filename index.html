<p>Santa Cruz's Verve has expanded and expanded to L.A. in a big way, particularly in its brand new Arts District location, a 2 story, 7,000 square-foot cafe and coffee roastery , which is now its L.A. flagship.

There are also beans for sale, as well as other coffee-related essentials such as filters and pour-over systems as well as an entire program built around support for farmers and sustainability.

<p>Menotti's Coffee Shop--with a focus on the "stop"--feels like a welcoming sanctuary from the busy touristic crowds: the nearby Venice Boardwalk and a trendy neighborhood within Culver City. The interiors are warm however, the decor is a bit spartan with most of the attention focusing on the selection of beans. There isn't any seating, but there are records playing on vinyl and plenty of enjoyable and up-to-date house music. Consider your short "stop" and that espresso tonic for a shot of tranquility to carry around the Boardwalk.</p>
