<p>Coffee,
 plenty of it, coupled with a short break in any of Los Angeles' finest 
coffee shops. It doesn't matter if it's served with a delicious lunch or
 enjoyed as a midday [break time], having a dependable place to drink 
java is as essential for Angelenos as a dependable local taco stand.<br><br>Where
 can you get an excellent cup? While opinions may be different, we've 
compiled the largest citywide guide that includes places with great, 
carefully procured coffee, tasty sweets and pastries and stunning 
interiors (and sometimes exteriors) as well as other interesting 
sustainable and environmentally-conscious elements. For those who love 
their coffee there are also minimalist places that will satisfy any 
coffee enthusiast. To assist you in finding the perfect cup We've taken a
 sip through the top spots around town. Read our guide, refill and go 
out again. There's plenty to accomplish.<br><br>The Go Get Em Tiger is 
the expanding coffee empire of Kyle Glanville and Charles Babinski the 
duo who founded the original G&amp;amp;B Coffee stall just so is its own
 mainstay in Grand Central Market. With eight locations in operation 
across all of the capital city. Go Get Em Tiger is fast becoming a local
 chain that is consistent and charm, yet with enough and a unique flavor
 at each location to keep things interesting. Customers can pick from 
take-away items and bottles of cold brew made in-house or grab the time 
to sit on the patio pleasure in the lively, entertaining places with 
breakfasty snacks and other merchandise for sale. Our recommendation? 
Try the macadamia and almond cappuccino made of milk.<br><br>Santa 
Cruz's Verve has expanded and expanded to L.A. in a big way, 
particularly in its brand new Arts District location, a 2 story, 7,000 
square-foot cafe and coffee roastery , which is now its L.A. flagship. 
The menu for all day is an array of diverse global food options, as well
 as some truly excellent coffee-based cocktails that are exclusive to 
the area. (Cascara negronis, anyone?) No where you go--Manhattan Beach 
Melrose, West Third and Downtown you'll also discover the signature 
Verve menu that includes classic espresso drinks as well as nitro cold 
brews by-the-cup selections and delicious snacks. There are also beans 
for sale, as well as other coffee-related essentials such as filters and
 pour-over systems as well as an entire program built around support for
 farmers and sustainability. The majority of L.A. locations are 
available for take-out or online ordering.<br><br>Menotti's Coffee 
Shop--with a focus on the "stop"--feels like a welcoming sanctuary from 
the busy touristic crowds: the nearby Venice Boardwalk and a trendy 
neighborhood within Culver City. The interiors are warm however, the 
decor is a bit spartan with most of the attention focusing on the 
selection of beans. There isn't any seating, but there are records 
playing on vinyl and plenty of enjoyable and up-to-date house music. 
Consider your short "stop" and that espresso tonic for a shot of 
tranquility to carry around the Boardwalk.<br><br></p>
